# Infinity Quest AI — Thanos’ Cosmic Hunt

## Project Overview
Infinity Quest AI is an advanced AI-powered 3D web simulation that visualizes Thanos’ epic quest to find the legendary Infinity Stones scattered across multiple planets. Using state-of-the-art genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning techniques, this project demonstrates autonomous exploration, adaptive learning, and intelligent decision-making within a dynamic cosmic environment.

Developed with Python for AI processing and Three.js for immersive 3D rendering, Infinity Quest AI serves as both a cutting-edge educational platform and an engaging visualization of artificial intelligence in action.

## Why This Project Matters
- Combines complex AI algorithms with real-time 3D simulation for an interactive learning experience.
- Visualizes AI decision-making processes, bridging theory and practice.
- Features a Marvel-inspired theme that makes learning fun and memorable.
- Modular design allows easy expansion and experimentation.
- Demonstrates practical skills in AI, web development, and 3D graphics.

### About thanos.glb

The project includes a 3D model file named `thanos.glb` which represents the character Thanos in the simulation. This file contains the detailed 3D mesh, textures, and animations used in the Three.js rendering. Due to its size and complexity, the model file is kept separate and is not included directly in this README.
